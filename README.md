## ⚠️ macOS Security Notice

Most applications in this tap are **open-source and unsigned**. macOS will likely block them by default with warnings like:

> "App" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.
> "App" is damaged and can’t be opened.

### ✅ How to bypass Gatekeeper

If you trust the application, you can allow it to run by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# Example for RClone Manager
xattr -cr "/Applications/RClone Manager.app"
```

Alternatively, you can **Right-click** the application in `/Applications` and select **Open**, then confirm in the dialog.

## 📌 Important Notes

- This tap is community-driven and maintained by **Zarestia-Dev**.
